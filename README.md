# Lab 6
###### By: Jacob Huebner - ITMD 361 Fall 2018 

In Lab 6 you must add javascript to an HTML file.
Use the provided HTML file and add a basic event handler to the page so that when the button is clicked the browser alerts the contents of the form input control added to your name and also changes the contents of the headline below the button to contain the contents of the form input control. 

## Instructions
```
Process:

1. Start with the provided Lab5.html file. 

2. Put all JavaScript for this Lab embedded in the html file. Only turn in this one HTML file. 

3. Add your name and email where indicated. 

4. Do not change the structure of the HTML other than adding your info noted in step 3 and adding your JavaScript to the page. 

5. Write JavaScript code to do the following things based on the demos we did in class. Add an event listener, and make the button show an alert box when it is clicked.

6. Submit the HTML file to the Basecamp collection of Labs.
